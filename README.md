# FedSeg: (Robust Federated MRI Segmentation via minimum γ-Divergence Estimation)
In this repo, we provide an FL framework which incorporates following features:
````
- Simple γ-mean aggregator
- γ-logistic dice loss
- Data-driven γ-selection methods for simple γ-mean and γ-logistic
- Locally adaptive FL paradigm: Ditto+FedBN
````
to be robust to Byzantine perturbation, mislabeled data in clients and is locally adaptive with data heterogeneity across clients.
