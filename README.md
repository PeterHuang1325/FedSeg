# FedSeg: (Robust Federated MRI Segmentation via minimum &gamma-Divergence Estimation)
In this repo, we provide an FL framework which incorporates following features:
'''
- Simple &gamma-mean aggregator
- &gamma-logistic dice loss
- Data-driven &gamma-selection methods for simple &gamma-mean and &gamma-logistic
- Locally adaptive FL paradigm: Ditto+FedBN
'''
to be robust to Byzantine perturbation, mislabeled data in clients and is locally adaptive with data heterogeneity across clients.
